# The Dev Workflow

"The greatest art is the concealment of art"

What is happening?
What do I want to have happen?

input -> logic -> output

![](img/typing.gif)

Command line words -> sum (nums) -> num -> console.log(num)

## Research

Googling!
context ->

MDN

## Comments
Write lots of comments to help you understand your code later
That which was my test is now my documentation

console.log(sum(process.argv));


## Functions

1. What does the function accept as arguments?
2. What does the function return?
3. How does the function change things?

If a function doesn't do 2 or 3, it is useless.
